Project name: d_d

Project aims/goals: 
- Produce a secure chat program 
	v1 linux platform
	v2 cross platform
- using Public Key technology to encrypt and verify communications between multiple parties
- Easy to use from user P.O.V (eventually)

Development Process:
- Paired programming
- iterative model (small, we are making it for ourselves, we know what we want)
- documentation (Java docs)
- testing (testng)
				
Project technology outline:
- PGP lib (GPG, free and opensource)
- Linux (Arch)
- git
- languages (Java, GO, Python)
- FLOOBITS (paired programming online tool)
- IDE/Text editors (netbeans, scene builder, vim, ipython notebook)

Simple overview:
- User opens software
- User types in private key password/passphrase 
- software sends encrypted message to server (pi) (sign(encrypt))
- server verifies its a me, mario
- Server tells client software who else is on
- User can chat with individual user or all connected users
- Messages are stored with encryption so whenever someone logs on, they can view messages that have been left
- Think of it like a secure dead drop
- then we can make things pretty, give it a GUI etc
